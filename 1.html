    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification"> Hyper Text Markup Language
            (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language[a] for <strong>creating <u>web</u>
            pages</strong>
        and web applications. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
        such
        as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia
        web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its
        appearance.
    </p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by
        denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into
        the
        page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element
        tags.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of
        web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
        former
        maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
        presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily
        using the element, together with JavaScript.</p>
